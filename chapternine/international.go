/*

Your program will need to shift uppercase and lowercase letters by –3. Remember that
'a' becomes 'x' , 'b' becomes 'y' , and 'c' becomes 'z' , and likewise for uppercase letters.
Experiment: international.go
Cipher the Spanish message “Hola Estación Espacial Internacional” with ROT13. Mod-
ify listing 9.7 to use the range keyword. Now when you use ROT13 on Spanish text, char-
acters with accents are preserved.
